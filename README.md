# Neurolab
Neurolab is an app designed to help nurses/healthcare assistants keep track of their patients progression by measuring various cognitive abilities. These abilities are measured by having their patients play mini games, and the results are shown in a graph which enables the nurse/healthcare assistant to see any trends in the patients ability, be it progression or decline.

Note that the app was designed for a specific device and, due to the short time restraint of our project, we were unable to make the application scale to fit any device. To use this app in the way that we designed it, use an emulator of a Samsung Galaxy Tab E, 1280*800, 9.6 inch screen.
